	Degree Project: NUMM03 for Master's Degree in Numerical Analysis \\

	Advisor: Jane Doe\\
	Examiner: --\\ 
	Time:  January 20, 2025 -- June 8, 2025\\
    Preliminary examination date: June 8, 2025
	
	\subsubsection*{Content}
	This project focuses on reduced-order modeling (ROM), a technique for simplifying complex systems, and its integration with novel machine learning approaches, specifically addressing model problems in numerical analysis and computational physics (e.g., Burgers' equation).\\
    
    \noindent The thesis integrates Operator Inference (OpInf), a data-driven method for approximating reduced-order operators, with Neural ODEs by using the adjoint state method. OpInf uses time series data $\{\mathbf{q}(t_i)\}$ from complex systems to infer reduced-order operators $\{\hat{f}(\mathbf{q}, \bm{\Theta})\}$. By optimizing parameters $\bm{\Theta}$ using a loss function tied to system dynamics, this work explores efficient gradient computation during training through adjoint operators.\\

    The main objectives of the thesis are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Derive and reformulate the adjoint problem for Neural ODEs in the context of OpInf's integral form.
        \item Bridge classical numerical analysis techniques (e.g., ROM) with modern machine learning methods.
    \end{itemize}
